Google Android Architecture --- MVP
===================================

# 目标

>The Android framework offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to defining how to organize and architect an Android app. This freedom, whilst very valuable, can also result in apps with large classes, inconsistent naming and architectures (or lack of) that can make testing, maintaining and extending difficult.

>Android Architecture Blueprints is meant to demonstrate possible ways to help with these common problems. In this project we offer the same application implemented using different architectural concepts and tools.

>You can use these samples as a reference or as a starting point for creating your own apps. The focus here is on code structure, architecture, testing and maintainability. However, bear in mind that there are many ways to build apps with these architectures and tools, depending on your priorities, so these shouldn't be considered canonical examples. The UI is deliberately kept simple.
